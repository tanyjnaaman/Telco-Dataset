# Telco Dataset
 Here, I explore some machine learning techniques for handling tabular data.

 # Process
 1. Exploration and development of models
 
 Using a Jupyter Notebook to document my findings and progress, I explore the dataset and develop several models and attempt to engineer features to improve performance. 

 2. (To-do) Deployment

 I will deploy the best performing model using FastAPI. 

 # How to
 Stay tuned!
