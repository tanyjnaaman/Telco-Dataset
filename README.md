# Telco Dataset
 Here, I explore some machine learning techniques for handling tabular data.

 # Process
 1. Literature
 
 My experience has laid more in computer vision and NLP, so I was not very familiar with machine learning and deep learnng techniques for structured tabular data. I was somewhat familiar with tree-based techniques. So, I looked through the relevant literature and later attempted to implement some of these models.

 The papers are documented in "literature". 

 2. Exploration and development of models

 Using a Jupyter Notebook to document my findings and progress, I explore the dataset and develop several models and attempt to engineer features to improve performance. 

 3. (To-do) Deployment

 I will deploy the best performing model using FastAPI. 

 # How to
 Stay tuned!
